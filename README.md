# Monte Carlo simulation of percolation in multilayer systems

# Requirements

A modern C compiler (GCC or Clang) and the following libraries:

- [GSL (GNU Scientific Library)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
- NCurses

For compiling the code, the CMake build system is needed.

# Usage

The code uses the CMake system, therefore it will be compiled with the commands `mkdir build`, `cd build`, `cmake ..`.

Then go back to the main folder, and run the code with the command `./build/multilayer`.
